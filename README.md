# How to start
First we have to create an virtual environment and activate it:

- in Powershell:
``` python -m venv env ```
``` env/Scripts/activate ```

- in Bash:
``` python3 -m venv env ```
``` source env/bin/activate ```

Then we need to install libraries:
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
